// Microsoft's version of gl.h invokes macros that are defined in
// windows.h.  To avoid a conditional #include <windows.h> in
// every file, we wrap gl.h with the proper conditions here, and
// have our source files #include "glwrap.h" instead.

// As a bonus we ensure that all declarations for GLU are included,
// and on X11-based systems, we cover X11 and GLX as well.  This
// should cover nearly everything needed by a typical glean test.

// It's unfortunate that both Windows and Xlib are so casual about
// polluting the global namespace.  The problem isn't easily resolved,
// even with the use of C++ namespace directives, because (a) macros
// in the include files refer to unqualified global variables, and (b)
// preprocessor macros themselves aren't affected by namespaces.
