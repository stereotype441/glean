<H1>What is <I>glean</I>?</H1>

<P>
<I>glean</I> is a suite of tools for evaluating the quality of an
OpenGL implementation and diagnosing any problems that are discovered.
<I>glean</I> also has the ability to compare two OpenGL implementations and
highlight the differences between them.

<P>
Who should care about <I>glean</I>?

<UL>
  <LI>Anyone who buys or reviews graphics cards.
  <BR>
    <I>glean</I> gives you the ability to compare performance, features,
    and image quality of different graphics cards.  Since the source code
    is freely available, you can customize <I>glean</I> to add tests for
    the things that are most important to you.

  <LI>Software developers.
  <BR>
    With <I>glean</I> you can learn which features really work for a
    given combination of hardware and driver.  You can also find the
    timing for basic drawing operations, mode changes, texture
    downloads, etc. so that you can maximize the performance of your
    application.

  <LI>OpenGL driver developers.
  <BR>
    <I>glean</I> can increase your confidence that your driver software
    is correct and efficient.  It also allows you to compare a new release
    to a previous release, to make sure that there are no regressions in
    quality or performance.

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:johan.smet@glo.be">Johan Smet</A> took on the Herculean
job of porting <I>glean</I> to Microsoft Windows.  The importance of
this work cannot be understated!  In addition to making <I>glean</I>
useful to a great many more people, it enlarges the pool of developers
that can contribute to <I>glean</I>.

<I>glean</I>'s home on the Web.

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:cass@r3.nu">Cass Everitt</A> suggested several improvements
in the ways <I>glean</I> uses C++.
