<H1>Adding new tests to <I>glean</I></H1>

<P>
On this page, we'll consider some general testing principles and
suggest areas in which new tests are needed.
When you're ready to implement a new test, check out the
<A HREF="overview.html">overview of <I>glean</I> internals</A>.

<H2>Guidelines for writing <I>glean</I> tests</H2>

<P>
To define a new test, first create a new test class derived from
<B>Test</B>.  Most of the time you'll want to write tests
that run on all drawing surface configurations and are portable
(in the sense that they don't use any OS- or window-system-dependent
data structures exposed in the <B>Environment</B>, <B>WindowSystem</B>,
and <B>DrawingSurface</B> classes).  Starting from <B>BasicTest</B> may
be easiest in those cases.

<P>
Once you've created a new test class, create one or more global
objects of that class.  The constructor for <B>Test</B> ensures that
all such objects are automatically linked onto the master list of
tests.  (Creating test objects dynamically isn't recommended, but if
you can make a good argument for it we can figure out the rules needed to
make it work.) Every test must have a good description; it's very much
worthwhile to add text that will help the user understand the results
or debug the problem if something goes wrong.

<P>
The first workhorse method in any test class is <B>run()</B>.
Here are some things to remember about it:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
  <LI>
    Every run must produce at least one PASS, FAIL, or NOTE message in the
    log.  
  <LI>
    In the case of failure, never just report failure and assume the user
    will go add debugging code to the source to figure out exactly what failure
    occurred.  Ideally, provide enough information so that a driver
    developer could start debugging his code without having to look at
    the <I>glean</I> source first.
  <LI>
    Each test is producing two kinds of result:  The result that goes into
    the results database, and the result that remains in memory, accessible
    through the test object.  Eventually there will be tests that refer
    back to the results of previous tests!  (This is the reason for the
    <B>hasRun</B> mechanism in the <B>Test</B> class; one test may be
    forced to run another as a prerequisite, but we never need to run a
    test twice.)
  <LI>
    Try to keep most test runs short.  Eventually there will be a lot of
    tests, and some machines will have a lot of drawing surface
    configurations, and runtime will add up.
  <LI>
    Whenever possible, avoid tests that just generate images for the
    user to check, rather than determining for themselves whether they
    pass or fail.  Even experts find it hard to tell which of two
    complicated images is correct, and when some subtle part of the
    OpenGL driver changes (like the precision with which colors are
    computed) the user might be faced with comparing hundreds or
    thousands of images for all existing tests.
  <LI>
    Prefer statistical summaries of error to simple pass/fail results.
    They provide a lot more useful information, and in some cases they
    make writing test comparisons much easier and more effective.
</UL>

<P>
The second major method is <B>compare()</B>.  Some things to keep in mind:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
  <LI>
    When two test results are the same (whatever that means for the
    particular test in question), don't report that they are the same
    unless the user has requested verbose output.  Ideally, if two
    test runs are identical, <I>glean</I> should report nothing.
  <LI>
    Subject to the constraint in the previous item, every comparison
    must yield at least one SAME or DIFF message in the log.
  <LI>
    As with <B>run()</B>, statistical summaries are preferable to simple
    pass/fail assessments.
</UL>

<H2>New tests</H2>

<P>
Here are some suggestions for tests that could be added to <I>glean</I>.
(These are not listed in any particular order; any of them would be
worthwhile.)

<UL TYPE=DISC>
  <LI>
    Quake3 Arena.
    <BR>
    We could use a set of tests that check everything John Carmack mentioned
    in <A HREF="http://www.quake3arena.com/news/glopt.html">
    http://www.quake3arena.com/news/glopt.html</A>.
  <LI>
    Default state check.
    <BR>
    The OpenGL spec defines initial values for all state variables, and
    many programs (including <I>glean</I>!) depend on those initial
    values being correct.  It would be great to have a test that actually
    verified them.
  <LI>
    Enumerant coverage check.
    <BR>
    It would be good to verify that each OpenGL command actually accepts
    all the argument values that it's supposed to accept, without generating
    an error.  Conversely, it would be nice to know that errors are
    generated appropriately when illegal arguments are used.
  <LI>
    Regression tests.
    <BR>
    (This is especially relevant to everyone working on Mesa.)
    Regression tests simply check that a previously-discovered bug or
    performance problem doesn't reappear after later changes to an OpenGL
    driver.  Regression tests are really valuable, because bugs tend to
    appear in the parts of the driver that are the most difficult to
    implement correctly.  Therefore, writing tests in response to each bug
    report tends to cluster tests in precisely the area where they're most
    needed.  As a general principle, whenever you report a bug or fix a bug,
    you could write a <I>glean</I> test to make sure that bug will never
    reappear.
  <LI>
    Stress tests.
    <BR>
    Stress tests assess the robustness of an OpenGL implementation.  Some
    possibilities are:  create and download many texture objects, then
    switch rapidly from one to another; perform many buffer swaps in
    rapid succession; execute ten thousand glClear() operations and see
    whether the hardware FIFO times out; and create a large number of windows
    and rendering contexts and randomly bind arbitrary pairs of them.
  <LI>
    Limits tests.
    <BR>
    Every OpenGL implementation has limits (sometimes enforced by the graphics
    hardware) and these often determine how applications must be written.
    For example, it would be good to know the maximum acceptable texture
    size for a variety of texture formats; the largest image that can
    be passed to glDrawPixels(); the maximum number of vertices that can
    be placed in a triangle strip or vertex array; and the maximum number of
    windows or rendering contexts that can be created.
  <LI>
    Window-system binding tests.
    <BR>
    Most tests concentrate on OpenGL itself, but an area that must not be
    overlooked is the window system binding (GLX or WGL).  It would be useful
    to test the window system binding's extension string and all the basic
    operations like context creation, copy, and deletion.  Sharing texture
    objects and display lists is important to test.
  <LI>
    Core OpenGL correctness tests.
    <BR>
    Most OpenGL implementations have been checked with the OpenGL
    conformance tests.  However, the conformance tests are lax in some
    areas due to historical reasons.  One way to address this would be
    to add some correctness tests to <I>glean</I>.  Check the contents
    page of the OpenGL spec; each heading is a good suggestion for a
    test.
