<H1>Building <I>glean</I> for GNU/Linux</H1>

<P>
The present versions of <I>glean</I> Makefiles depend on features of GNU make.
(In particular, the automatic re-scanning of all dependency files after
any have changed.)  If your version of make is known to be significantly
incompatible with GNU make, then you will need to acquire a copy of
GNU make or modify <I>glean</I>'s Makefiles.

<P>
<I>glean</I> makes extensive use of the C++ Standard Template Library.
If your C++ compiler fails to compile <I>glean</I>, you may want to try
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">the latest version of gcc</A>.
<I>glean</I> was originally developed with egcs 1.1.2; earlier versions are
missing some features that <I>glean</I> uses, such as namespaces.


<H2>Obtain the source code</H2>

<P>
Obtain the gzipped tar file containing <I>glean</I> from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?form_grp=430">the
<I>glean</I> downloads page on SourceForge</A>, or better yet,
grab a full source tree from the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=430">anonymous
CVS access page on SourceForge</A>.

<P>
Unpack the tar file:
<PRE>
    tar xfz glean-1-0.tgz
    cd glean_1_0
</PRE>
This will create a subdirectory named <KBD>glean_1_0</KBD> and
make it your current directory.

<H2>Set the GLEAN_ROOT environment variable</H2>

<P>
To compile or run <I>glean</I>, you will need to set the environment
variable <KBD>GLEAN_ROOT</KBD> to the full pathname of the <I>glean</I>
source directory.
If you're following along, this is your current directory, so
this command should do the trick for users of csh and its descendants:
<PRE>
    setenv GLEAN_ROOT `pwd`
</PRE>
and this command should work for users of sh and its descendants:
<PRE>
    GLEAN_ROOT=`pwd`; export GLEAN_ROOT
</PRE>
Be sure to set the environment variable each time you want to compile
or run <I>glean</I>.  Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to
set it in your shell's startup script.

<H2>Set Makefile options</H2>

<P>
Edit $GLEAN_ROOT/make/common.mak and modify the configuration variables
according to your preferences.  Some of the variables that are most
likely to need customization are:

<DL>
  <DT>CONFIG</DT>
  <DD>
    This variable selects the operating system and window system for which
    <I>glean</I> will be compiled.  The OS option must be either __UNIX__
    or __MS__.  The window-system option must be either __X11__ or __WIN__.
    (Yes, there is some ambiguity between the OS and the window system in
    Microsoft's case.  However, there are X11 products that run under
    Windows, so the combination of __MS__ and __X11__ is possible.)
    By default, this variable is set to "-D__UNIX__ -D__X11__".
  </DD>

  <DT>CC</DT>
  <DD>
    This variable specifies the location of the C++ compiler.
    By default it is "g++".
  </DD>

  <DT>XINC, GLINC, GLUTINC, TIFFINC</DT>
  <DD>
    These variables specify the directories containing include files for
    X, OpenGL, GLUT, and libtiff, respectively.
    The defaults are /usr/include/X11, /usr/local/include, /usr/local/include,
    and /usr/include, respectively.
  </DD>

  <DT>XLIB, GLLIB, GLUTLIB, TIFFLIB</DT>
  <DD>
    These variables specify the directories containing libraries
    (libX11, libGL, libglut, and libtiff, respectively).
    The defaults are /usr/X11R6/lib, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/lib, and
    /usr/lib, respectively.
  </DD>

  <DT>_INC, _OPT, _DBG, _WARN, _LIBDIR, _LIB, _PROF</DT>
  <DD>
    These variables define C++ command-line options for include-file
    directories, optimization, debugging, warnings, library directories,
    libraries, and profiling.  These apply universally, to all <I>glean</I>
    compilations.  Individual Makefiles can make local additions to
    these defaults by defining corresponding variables whose names
    do not have a leading underscore.  Note that it is possible to
    configure your system so that the <I>order</I> of include-file
    or library-file directories is significant; for example, by having
    two versions of the same include file, one in /usr/include and one
    in /usr/local/include.  In such cases, you'll need to make sure
    that the _INC and _LIB variables specify directories in precisely
    the order you require.
  </DD>
</DL>

<H2>Build <I>glean</I></H2>

<P>
When you've finished editing the Makefile, simply type
<PRE>
    cd src
    make install
</PRE>
This will build <I>glean</I> and the other tools in the suite, and install
everything in <KBD>$GLEAN_ROOT/bin</KBD>, <KBD>$GLEAN_ROOT/include</KBD>,
and <KBD>$GLEAN_ROOT/lib</KBD>.  Nothing will be altered outside the
<KBD>$GLEAN_ROOT</KBD> directory hierarchy.
<P>
Note that you <B>must</B> use <KBD>make install</KBD> rather than
plain <KBD>make</KBD>, otherwise the headers and libraries won't be
copied to <KBD>$GLEAN_ROOT</KBD> and subsequent components will fail
to build.
