<H1>What has changed recently?</H1>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.1 to Version 1.2</H2>

<B>1.2 XXX Not yet released!!!</B>

<P>
Added <i>--overwrite</i> command line option.
</P>
<P>
<i>glean --listtests --verbose</i> now lists all tests with their
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
Added the following new tests:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>texRect - tests GL_ARB_texture_rectangle. (Eric Anholt)
<LI>pixelFormats - tests all the different combinations of format, type and
internalFormat parameters for glTexImage2D (plus format/type for
glDrawPixels). (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>texture_srgb - tests the GL_EXT_texture_sRGBA extension. (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>readpixPerf - measures performance of glReadPixels with a number of pixel formats, with and without Pixel Buffer Objects. (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>fragProg1 - basic test of each ARB fragment program instruction (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>vertProg1 - basic test of each ARB vertex program instruction (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>depthStencil - test the GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil extension (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>fpexceptions - generates a number of floating point exceptions, shouldn't crash (Keith Whitwell and Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>pointAtten - test point size attenuation with GL_ARB_point_parameters (Brian Paul)</LI>
<LI>vertAttrib - test aliasing/non-aliasing behaviour of per-vertex calls (Brian Paul)</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 1.1</H2>

<P>
Updated documentation to reflect <I>glean</I>'s new home page on
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</A>.

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:adam@newsnipple.com">Adam Haberlach</A> of Be added
support for BeOS, as well as the "teapot" test.

<H2>Changes from Version 0.6 to Version 1.0</H2>

<P>
Added hints to set window position as well as size, so that users
of window managers without automatic window placement don't have
to click to create each test window.

<H2>Changes from Version 0.5 to Version 0.6</H2>

<P>
Replaced <KBD>*.dsw</KBD> and <KBD>*.dsp</KBD> files with nmake
makefiles (named <KBD>common.win</KBD> and <KBD>makefile.win</KBD>)
for building on Windows.

<P>
Added <A HREF="mailto:johan.smet@glo.be">Johan Smet's</A> documentation
for building glean on Windows.  This necessitated reworking the
documentation structure somewhat.

<P>
Fixed a storage allocation bug in the Windows version of <I>showvis</I>.

<P>
Fixed a couple of problems in libs/dsurf/dsconfig.cpp related to the
visual_rating extension that caused compilation errors on some
systems.  Thanks to Brian Paul for catching these.

<P>
Brian also reported some bizarre link errors.  These occurred because
there were multiple gl.h files installed on his system, and the
makefiles searched different header file directories for different
glean components.  This has been worked around by changing common.mak
and the individual makefiles to search for header files and libraries
in the same order for all components.  This is not a universal
solution; if your system has a very unusual configuration of library
or header directories, you may need to customize the makefiles.

<H2>Changes from Version 0.4 to Version 0.5</H2>

<P>
Incorporated the second set of <A HREF="mailto:johan.smet@glo.be">Johan
Smet's</A> changes to port <I>glean</I> to Microsoft Windows.

<H2>Changes from Version 0.3 to Version 0.4</H2>

<P>
Added the ability to include or exclude specific tests from a run.

<P>

A recent change in the behavior of the C++ string
<CODE>getline()</CODE> function in the GNU libraries caused
<I>glean</I>'s test comparison operation to appear to hang.  The new
behavior appears to be correct, but it was necessary to add a
workaround to <I>glean</I> so that it would run properly on both old
and new versions of the library.

<H2>Changes from Version 0.2 to Version 0.3</H2>

<P>
Incorporated the first set of <A HREF="mailto:johan.smet@glo.be">Johan
Smet's</A> changes to port <I>glean</I> to Microsoft Windows.  These included:

  <UL TYPE=DISC>
    <LI>
        VC6 still uses old-style scoping rules for variables declared
        in the init part of ``for'' statements, so in some cases new
        blocks or new variables were introduced to avoid collisions.

    <LI>
        VC6 has trouble with some styles of initialization in
        declarations; for example,
	<PRE>
        WindowSystem& ws(env->winSys);
	</PRE>
	had to be changed to
	<PRE>
        WindowSystem& ws = env->winSys;
	</PRE>

    <LI>
	Several items in the std namespace (notably the stream
	functions) weren't scoped correctly.  These were all fixed
	with ``using namespace std'' or explicit qualification, as
	needed.

    <LI>
	VC6 can't handle the template functions used for image packing
	and unpacking, so those were replaced.
  </UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 0.1 to Version 0.2</H2>

<P>
In lib/dsurf, bit counts for green and blue channels were reversed.
This caused incorrect drawing-surface configuration reports for normal
color channels and accumulation buffer channels, and also confused
code that determined errors in color values.

<P>
In lib/dsurf, the expression for computing bits-in-error was in error. :-)

<P>
Switched from egcs to g++ in common.mak.
