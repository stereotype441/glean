      <abstract>
        <it/glean/ is a suite of tools for evaluating the quality of an
        OpenGL implementation and for comparing the quality of two OpenGL
        implementations.  <it/glean/ is platform independent and currently
        runs under Linux, BeOS, and Windows.  Because the <it/glean/ suite
        is incomplete at this time, this paper discusses potential groups
        of <it/glean/ users, benefits for those users, and the classes of
        tests those users may be interested in having implemented.

    <sect>Introduction
      <p>
        The <it/glean/ suite contains:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            a main program, called <bf/glean/, that runs tests and compares
            the output between two tests,
          <item>
            several support programs to help with test interpretation, and
          <item>
            several class libraries that provide scaffolding and support
            services for writing additional tests.
        </itemize>
      <p>
        Currently (August 2000), the scaffolding and support libraries for
        <it/glean/ are complete, and 15 tests have been written.  These
        tests check the correctness of the OpenGL implementation being used
        and perform timing tests for some basic OpenGL functions.  Hundreds
        of additional tests need to be written to target the needs of
        different <it/glean/ users.  The following sections discuss the
        main classes of <it/glean/ users and the specific kinds of tests
        that would be most useful to them.
      <p>
        Since testing all of OpenGL is a large and daunting task, one of
        the goals for <it/glean/ is to avoid duplication of the
        functionality of SGI's OpenGL Conformance Test.  Instead,
        <it/glean/ tests will concentrate on areas that the Conformance
        Test does not cover:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            correctness tests for features missed by the Conformance Test
            (e.g., tests for recently approved ARB extensions),
          <item>
            very simple correctness tests for driver writers (i.e., to make
            running these tests during the driver implementation phase a
            trivially simple task),
          <item>
            capacity evaluation tests (e.g., to roughly determine how much
            texture memory is effectively available), and
          <item>
            performance tests.
        </itemize>

    <sect>Graphics Card Reviewers
      <p>
        Reviewers of graphics cards (or OpenGL drivers for graphics cards)
        can use <it/glean/ to compare performance, features, and image
        quality between different graphics cards (or the same graphics card
        when using a different driver or operating system).
      <p>
        We have not identified any specific tests that reviewers would
        require that are not already required by other categories of
        users.

    <sect>Software Developers
      <p>
        OpenGL application developers are interested in cross-platform
        testing the robustness and feature sets of the OpenGL
        implementation that they are using.  They are also interested in
        performance measurements of specific drawing operations, mode
        changes, texture downloads, and other parameters that will help
        them to maximize the performance of the application on each
        platform.
      <p>
        For example, a discussion of Quake3 &lsqb;QUAKE3&rsqb; points out
        that the game makes extensive use of <tt/glDrawElements()/,
        multitextures, and compiled vertex arrays.  Further, experience has
        show that hardware optimization of triangle back face culling and
        guard band clipping may make an implementation slower or
        incorrect.  Having correctness and performance tests for these
        areas would help the game developers to determine which OpenGL
        features are widely and correctly implemented, and would help
        OpenGL driver developers to optimize pathways used by specific
        games.

    <sect>OpenGL/Mesa Driver Developers
      <p>
        Driver developers are interested in very simple tests that measure
        the performance and correctness of specific OpenGL pathways.  They
        are also interested in comparing results between driver versions to
        make sure that there are no regressions in quality or performance.
      <p>
        During the initial stages of driver development, the most useful
        tests are simple, coarse tests of basic functionality.  Driver
        developers would be interested in tests that quickly verify:
        <itemize>
          <item>
            alpha blend modes
          <item>
            alpha test modes
          <item>
            depth test modes
          <item>
            texture environment modes
          <item>
            texture combine modes
          <item>
            back face culling
          <item>
            scissors
        </itemize>
        Quick verification tests could just draw two overlapping polygons
        and verify that all three regions are drawn correctly.  A more
        thorough test would verify sub-pixel precision of the rasterized
        triangles and the accuracy of the color blends, but this
        thoroughness is not needed during the initial stages of driver
        implementation.
      <p>
        The driver writer would also benefit from a simple test that would
        do a full enumeration of all the texture environment modes, and
        from performance tests that measure the performance of individual
        primitives (e.g., multitextured, smooth-shaded triangle fans).
        Some performance information is generated by other commonly
        available tools (e.g., <tt/viewperf/ and <tt/glperf/
        &lsqb;reference?&rsqb;), but having these extremely tests available
        in <it/glean/ may make them more accessible, especially if they
        were combined with other tests that are helpful for driver writers.
        
    <sect>Jobs List
      <p>
        This section contains a partially categorized list of test that
        could be implemented for <it/glean/.  A majority of the list was
        obtained by reviewing postings to the <tt/opengl-gamedev/ mailing
        list.  We assume that all of the OpenGL drivers discussed on that
        list have passed the Conformance Test and that any remaining
        problems should be tested for by <tt/glean/.

            These tests are described in &lsqb;MIPMAP&rsqb; and are
            probably already covered by the Conformance Test.

          <p>
            These tests are ones that are thought to be especially
            beneficial to the driver writer.  Although some of these are
            covered by the Conformance Test or in <tt/viewperf/, they would
            also be beneficial if they were all implemented in <it/glean/
            as a special suite of tests for driver implementers.
