Description:

	For common extensions, verify that GetProcAddress returns
	non-NULL pointers for all the functions that are supposed to
	belong to each extension.

Description:

	Support standalone Voodoo cards under Win32.  Suggest using
	the glsetup API.

	Neal says:

		One problem which you may not be aware of is that its hard
		to determine whether or not 3dfxvgl.dll can actually be
		used safely.  The problem is that even if the driver's
		been installed, the 3dfx card might have been taken out
		later, leaving a driver which faults as soon as you load
		the 3dfxvgl dll.  As far as I know, the only truly safe
		way to deal with this is to check for the presence of
		the Glide dlls, load glide if they're present, and then
		use the Glide API (grGetNumBoards or something with a
		vaguely similar name) to actually detect the presence
		of the hardware.  If its there, you should be able to
		load 3dfxvgl.dll safely.

Description:

	Support dynamic display resolution changes under Win32.

	Win95 doesn't really support this well, and some drivers
	don't handle it correctly for Win98.  One workaround would
	be to document that users should change the display resolution
	manually before running glean.

Description:

	Add an option to allow overwriting the results directory.

Description:

	Add an option to allow selection of a particular OpenGL
	driver (for systems on which multiple drivers may coexist).

Description:

	Add a test that determines the mipmap LOD bias.

	Gary says:

		I would recommend someone write a simple test subroutine
		that determines the LOD bias.  This could be done
		by rendering a small texture map, e.g. 2x2 or 4x4,
		with mipmaps at varying texel:pixel ratios and then
		reading the pixels back from the framebuffer. The code
		could then determine exactly where the LOD changes,
		and thus what the implicit LOD bias is, at least for
		non-perspective textures.

Description:

	Write a test to check operations on shared dlists and textures.

Submitted by:

	Kevin Martin <kevinm@valinux.com>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

	The ttexcombine test sometimes fails because a texture format
	has less precision than the framebuffer format, and the
	test's error tolerances are based solely on the framebuffer
	format.  Should modify tolerances to take texture format into
	account.
