1.0 to 1.1:
===========

Updated documentation to reflect glean's new home page on
sourceforge.net.

Adam Haberlach <adam@newsnipple.com> of Be added support for BeOS, as
well as the "teapot" test.

Prep work for new tests that rely on drawing lots of triangles, and
being able to confirm that they're drawn:  Added RGBCodedID class (which
maps an integer identifier into a unique RGB triple, and vice versa).
Added SpiralStrip2D and SpiralTri2D classes, which generate lots
of geometry with well-defined characteristics.

Fixed a bug in the RandomMesh2D algorithm, which sometimes generated
overlapping triangles.

Added translation by 0.375 (as recommended by the Red Book) to the GL
utility that sets up a simple mapping from object to screen
coordinates.

Added haveExtension() to GLUtils so that tests can conveniently check
for the existence of a particular extension, and haveExtensions()
so that they can check for an entire set of extensions at once.

Added getProcAddress() to GLUtils to fetch addresses of extension
functions.

Added logGLErrors() to GLUtils to write textual versions of OpenGL
errors to the logfile.

Added the vertex-performance tests (coloredLitPerf, ...) that compare
various ways of supplying vertex data to determine which is fastest.

Added OpenGL state-setting "cheat-sheet."

Added syntactic-sugar objects GLUtils::Light, GLUtils::LightModel, and
GLUtils::Material for setting lighting parameters.

Added --listtests option, which lists all the test names in sorted
order and then exits.

Added tests for pixel-exact rendering in the 2D orthographic projection
case that's described in the appendix of the Red Book.  (Per suggestion
from Brian Paul <brian@valinux.com>.)

Added test for MakeCurrent functionality, checking all combinations
of direct, indirect, and null contexts.

Brian Paul added tests for masked clear and for the
EXT_texture_env_combine extension.

Made ErrorBits() function available in misc.h, so that all tests can
conveniently compute accuracy in terms of the number of color-channel
bits.  (Was in tblend.cpp.)

Added a new constructor to the class BasicTest (tbasic.cpp) which allows
the user to specify (as a string) a list of names of extensions which
must be supported by a rendering context before the test will be run on
that context.  Modified the EXT_texture_env_combine test to use it.

Fixed a bug reported by Rik Faith; comparison of two test databases
now continues even if some results are missing from one or both
databases.


0.6 to 1.0:
===========

Added hints to set window position as well as size, so that users
of window managers without automatic window placement don't have
to click to create each test window.

0.5 to 0.6:
===========

Replaced *.dsw and *.dsp files with nmake makefiles (named
makefile.win) for building on Windows.

Added Johan Smet's documentation for building glean on Windows.  This
necessitated reworking the documentation structure somewhat.

Fixed a storage allocation bug in the Windows version of showvis.

Fixed a couple of problems in libs/dsurf/dsconfig.cpp related to the
visual_rating extension that caused compilation errors on some
systems.  Thanks to Brian Paul for catching these.

Brian also reported some bizarre link errors.  These occurred because
there were multiple gl.h files installed on his system, and the
makefiles searched different header file directories for different
glean components.  This has been worked around by changing common.mak
and the individual makefiles to search for header files and libraries
in the same order for all components.  This is not a universal
solution; if your system has a very unusual configuration of library
or header directories, you may need to customize the makefiles.

0.4 to 0.5:
===========

Incorporated the second set of Johan Smet's <johan.smet@glo.be>
changes to port glean to Microsoft Windows.

0.3 to 0.4:
===========

Added the ability to include or exclude specific tests from a run.

A recent change in the behavior of the C++ string getline() function
in the GNU libraries caused glean's test comparison operation to
appear to hang.  The new behavior appears to be correct, but it was
necessary to add a workaround to glean so that it would run properly
on both old and new versions of the library.


0.2 to 0.3:
===========

Incorporated the first set of Johan Smet's <johan.smet@glo.be> changes
to port glean to Microsoft Windows.  These included:

        VC6 still uses old-style scoping rules for variables declared
        in the init part of ``for'' statements, so in some cases new
        blocks or new variables were introduced to avoid collisions.

        VC6 has trouble with some styles of initialization in
        declarations; for example,
                WindowSystem& ws(env->winSys);
        had to be changed to
                WindowSystem& ws = env->winSys;

        Several items in the std namespace (notably the stream
        functions) weren't scoped correctly.  These were all fixed
        with ``using namespace std'' or explicit qualification, as
        needed.

        VC6 can't handle the template functions used for image packing
        and unpacking, so those were replaced.


0.1 to 0.2:
===========

In lib/dsurf, bit counts for green and blue channels were reversed.
This caused incorrect drawing-surface configuration reports for normal
color channels and accumulation buffer channels, and also confused
code that determined errors in color values.

In lib/dsurf, the expression for computing bits-in-error was in error. :-)

Switched from egcs to g++ in common.mak.
