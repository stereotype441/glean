1.0 to 1.1:
===========

Updated documentation to reflect glean's new home page on
sourceforge.net.

Adam Haberlach <adam@newsnipple.com> of Be added support for
BeOS, as well as the "teapot" test.


0.6 to 1.0:
===========

Added hints to set window position as well as size, so that users
of window managers without automatic window placement don't have
to click to create each test window.

0.5 to 0.6:
===========

Replaced *.dsw and *.dsp files with nmake makefiles (named
makefile.win) for building on Windows.

Added Johan Smet's documentation for building glean on Windows.  This
necessitated reworking the documentation structure somewhat.

Fixed a storage allocation bug in the Windows version of showvis.

Fixed a couple of problems in libs/dsurf/dsconfig.cpp related to the
visual_rating extension that caused compilation errors on some
systems.  Thanks to Brian Paul for catching these.

Brian also reported some bizarre link errors.  These occurred because
there were multiple gl.h files installed on his system, and the
makefiles searched different header file directories for different
glean components.  This has been worked around by changing common.mak
and the individual makefiles to search for header files and libraries
in the same order for all components.  This is not a universal
solution; if your system has a very unusual configuration of library
or header directories, you may need to customize the makefiles.

0.4 to 0.5:
===========

Incorporated the second set of Johan Smet's <johan.smet@glo.be>
changes to port glean to Microsoft Windows.

0.3 to 0.4:
===========

Added the ability to include or exclude specific tests from a run.

A recent change in the behavior of the C++ string getline() function
in the GNU libraries caused glean's test comparison operation to
appear to hang.  The new behavior appears to be correct, but it was
necessary to add a workaround to glean so that it would run properly
on both old and new versions of the library.


0.2 to 0.3:
===========

Incorporated the first set of Johan Smet's <johan.smet@glo.be> changes
to port glean to Microsoft Windows.  These included:

        VC6 still uses old-style scoping rules for variables declared
        in the init part of ``for'' statements, so in some cases new
        blocks or new variables were introduced to avoid collisions.

        VC6 has trouble with some styles of initialization in
        declarations; for example,
                WindowSystem& ws(env->winSys);
        had to be changed to
                WindowSystem& ws = env->winSys;

        Several items in the std namespace (notably the stream
        functions) weren't scoped correctly.  These were all fixed
        with ``using namespace std'' or explicit qualification, as
        needed.

        VC6 can't handle the template functions used for image packing
        and unpacking, so those were replaced.


0.1 to 0.2:
===========

In lib/dsurf, bit counts for green and blue channels were reversed.
This caused incorrect drawing-surface configuration reports for normal
color channels and accumulation buffer channels, and also confused
code that determined errors in color values.

In lib/dsurf, the expression for computing bits-in-error was in error. :-)

Switched from egcs to g++ in common.mak.
